Some property may not be included in your estate, for example some jointly held property or property for which you have named a beneficiary. You may have a will that says what you want to be done with your estate when you die. If you don't have a will, provincial laws set out what will happen to your estate. If you add your estate as a beneficiary, speak to a legal advisor.</beneficiaryEstateMessage>
