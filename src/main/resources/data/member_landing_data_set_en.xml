            <item>In addition to the information in your member booklet that's provided by your plan administrator, here are some extra notes about your plan.</item>
            <item>When you enrol and become a member, and if your plan allows it, you can choose whoâ€™ll receive the value of your plan when you die. This is called designating a beneficiary. The monetary amount your beneficiary receives is called the death benefit.</item>
            <item>The death benefit is paid to your beneficiary within 30 days after Canada Life receives all supporting documents requested (e.g. proof of death, etc.). This timeframe could be shorter depending on your policy.</item>
